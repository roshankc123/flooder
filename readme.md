flooder brings flood in web,
up to now it can flood comment in mbasic.facebook posts,
this is written in bash and uses simple grep logic,
curl and grep are base,

this hasn't been completed due to some issue and test shows one's id can be blocked because of invalid link usage,
i don not recommend using your own personal account , 
i created some test accounts and 2 out of 3 is blocked,(sometime they block your ip too.)


with deeper programing knowledge this can be implemented in and for any system ,
